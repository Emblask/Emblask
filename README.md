# Hello there. Emblask here.
This project is a life-long one, constantly reiterating to improve and ocassionally fixing bugs.
##### Main Features
  - Love learning new stuff
  - Enjoy challenges
 
### What is my relationship with programming?
Basically I find in programming a tool to make whatever on earth I want. Making creative and new ways to solve any given problem in my heart and with a powerful tool such as programming, I've been having nothing but fun!

### What do I do besides programming?
  - I love languages in general, so far I only know english and spanish, but have been learning German for a while now (not quite enough to claim that I speak it)
  - Enjoy music a lot, I know how to play the piano and I'm trying to learn to play the guitar!
  - I play video games.

### Thank you!
